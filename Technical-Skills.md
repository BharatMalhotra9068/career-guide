# Technical Skills for a Cybersecurity Career

In cybersecurity, technical skills are essential to understand threats, vulnerabilities, and protection mechanisms. This guide outlines the key skills every aspiring cybersecurity professional should develop, with links to resources for learning and practice.

## 1. Networking Fundamentals

Understanding networking is the backbone of cybersecurity. You need to know how data moves across networks and how different protocols work to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Key Networking Concepts

- **OSI and TCP/IP Models**: Learn the layers of each model and their functions, focusing on how data is packaged, transmitted, and received.
- **Common Protocols**: Understand TCP, UDP, IP, DNS, HTTP/S, ARP, and ICMP. Familiarize yourself with the structure of each protocol and its potential vulnerabilities.
- **Subnets and IP Addressing**: Practice subnetting, which allows you to efficiently allocate IP addresses within networks.
- **Network Devices**: Routers, switches, firewalls, and gateways all play different roles. Learn how they control data flow and secure networks.

### Practical Exercises

- **Wireshark**: Analyze network traffic, focusing on how protocols interact. Start by capturing HTTP requests and inspecting TCP handshakes.
- **Traceroute**: Use tools like `traceroute` (Linux) or `tracert` (Windows) to trace data paths through a network. This will give you insight into network topologies and potential chokepoints.

### Recommended Resources

- **Books**: *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* by Kurose and Ross.

## 2. Operating System Proficiency

As a cybersecurity professional, understanding both Windows and Linux operating systems is crucial since both are widely used and have unique security considerations.

### Linux

Linux is popular in cybersecurity due to its open-source nature, flexibility, and extensive command-line capabilities. Focus on:

- **Command Line Basics**: Essential commands for file management (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`), process management (`ps`, `kill`), and networking (`ifconfig`, `netstat`).
- **Permissions and Ownership**: Master the `chmod` and `chown` commands to secure files.
- **Scripting**: Bash scripting can help automate tasks and execute batch commands, which is useful for security analysis.

### Windows

Windows knowledge is essential for enterprise security and malware analysis. Focus on:

- **PowerShell**: Learn PowerShell for automation, system administration, and forensics.
- **Windows Event Logs**: Understand how to navigate and interpret event logs, which are critical for incident response.
- **Registry**: Familiarize yourself with the Windows registry structure, where many malware hide their traces.

### Practice Labs

- **OverTheWire’s Bandit**: Beginner-friendly Linux challenges focusing on command-line tasks.
- **Windows PowerShell Labs**: Practice common PowerShell commands and scripts through resources like Microsoft Learn.

### Recommended Resources

## 3. Programming Skills

Programming is essential for automating tasks, writing scripts, and understanding how applications work to secure them effectively.

### Recommended Languages

- **Python**: The go-to language for cybersecurity due to its simplicity and rich libraries for scripting, data analysis, and networking.
- **Bash**: Master Bash scripting on Linux for automating tasks and managing files.
- **JavaScript**: Essential for web application security and understanding client-side vulnerabilities like XSS.
- **SQL**: Used in database management and essential for preventing SQL injection attacks.

### Practical Exercises

- **Python Scripting**: Practice with small programs like a port scanner or an automated file backup script.
- **Web Scraping**: Use Python’s BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape web data, keeping ethical considerations in mind.
- **SQL Injection Labs**: WebGoat and DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) provide SQL injection practice in a safe environment.

### Recommended Resources

- **Python Books**: *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart.
- **Courses**: [Codecademy Python](https://codecademy.com/learn/python), [Hack The Box’s Intro to Scripting](https://hackthebox.com/).

## 4. Cybersecurity Tools and Techniques

Hands-on skills with specific cybersecurity tools will help you assess and secure networks, applications, and data.

### Key Tools to Learn

- **Nmap**: A powerful tool for network scanning. Learn how to use its basic commands (`nmap -sP`, `nmap -A`, etc.) and advanced options like service and version detection.
- **Wireshark**: Master packet capturing and analysis to detect anomalies in network traffic.
- **Metasploit**: For penetration testing. Learn how to exploit known vulnerabilities in virtual environments safely.
- **Burp Suite**: For web application security testing. Focus on scanning for vulnerabilities, analyzing HTTP requests, and using tools like Intruder and Repeater.

### Practical Exercises

- **Nmap Scanning**: Use Nmap to scan different IP ranges and understand open ports and services.
- **Capture the Flag (CTF)**: CTF challenges on Hack The Box, TryHackMe, or picoCTF help develop tool proficiency in real scenarios.
- **Set Up a Lab**: Create a virtual lab environment using VirtualBox or VMware, where you can practice safely.
